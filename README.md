# Hey, I'm Peter Eniola 👋

Software developer who loves building mobile and web apps — from pixel-perfect UI to bulletproof APIs. 🚀

I work with **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile 📱, **JavaScript/TypeScript** on the frontend 🌐, and **Node.js** on the backend ⚙️. I care about clean code, good architecture, and shipping things that actually work.



### 🛠️ Tech I use regularly

- 📱 **Mobile** — Flutter, Dart
- 🎨 **Frontend** — React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS
- ⚙️ **Backend** — Node.js, Express, REST APIs
- 🗄️ **Databases** — PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase
- 🔧 **Tools** — Git, Docker, Vercel, Railway



### 🌱 Currently

Working on improving my system design skills and building a few side projects. Always open to collaborating on interesting problems — let's build something cool! 🤝
